**_The WAZE of Music_**

##What's the problem?

**_Suggestions are too broad and inaccurate_**

Computer-generated recommendations attempt to take an objective approach to something that is inherently subjective.

##What's our solution?

**_Community-generated music recommendations_**

Crowdsourced recommendations from people with relevant music knowledge will produce the most accurate suggestions.

##About the App

Vurs is a user generated song recommendation app. Users are able to search for songs using the search bar located at the top of the page and can then click on the song they wish to listen to. This will begin playing in the audio player located at the bottom at the page. Users have the option to pause, play, mute, unmute, skip, and replay previous songs.

When a song is playing, the recommondations for that song will be displayed. The top 3 recommended songs will be displayed giving the user the ability to add those songs to a playlist, or simply listen to the recommendations that other users have made.

In order to view or make recommendations, the user must log in using their Soundcloud credentials. They may also create a Soundcloud account in order to log in if they do not already have one. The user then has the option to add their own recommondation or play existing recommondations.

Once logged in, a list of the users' playlists are imported from their Soundcloud account and displayed on the left of the page. The user has the option to add additional playlists and edit their current playlists. These changes will only be made in their Vurs account. The playlist titles are displayed and by clicking on it, the songs in that playlist will be displayed. The user has the option to play any one of those songs and view recommondations for those songs.  

Vurs is a great way to discover new music generated by users' recommondations and listen to music straight from the app!

##Design Approach
Landing:
![Landing Page Picture](https://i.imgur.com/CuLTVlJ.jpg)
Our original design was for our landing page was to have one search bar centered in the middle of the page. Any user will be able search songs, however if a user would like to create a playlist, upvote a song, or make a recommendation, they would have to log in.

Main Page:
![Main Page Picture](https://i.imgur.com/OgR3UTK.jpg)
Once logged in, users will be able to see their playlist (which is imported from their SoundCloud account). Once they click on a recommended song, another path will show up with the top recommendations for that song that they click. If they  choose to upvote or post a song, they can do so in the main view/window.
