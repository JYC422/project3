_The WAZE of Music Applications_

Music applications such as Spotify, Pandora, and GrooveShark attempt to provide users with song preferences based on algorithmic-generated music recommendations. 

###**So what's the problem?**

**Discover new music by a query.**

These recommendations attempt to take an object approach to music.. something that is inherently subjective.

###**What's our solution?**

**Community generated music recommendations.**


Crowdsourcing recommendations based on what users have listened to in the past could solve our algorithmic-based recommendations. Why? Because people are better at choosing things that require subjectivity.

##Our Model

##Design Approach
**Landing:**
![Landing Page Picture](https://i.imgur.com/cJYeVv2.png)
Our original design was for our landing page was to have one search bar centered in the middle of the page. Any user will be able search songs, however if a user would like to create a playlist, upvote a song, or make a recommendation, they would have to log in.

**Main Page:**

Once logged in, users will be able to see their playlist (which is imported from their SoundCloud account). Once they click on a recommended song, another path will show up with the top recommendations for that song that they click. If they  choose to upvote or post a song, they can do so in the main view/window.
