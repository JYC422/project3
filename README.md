**_The WAZE of Music_**

Music applications such as Spotify, Pandora, and GrooveShark attempt to provide users with song preferences based on algorithmic-generated music recommendations. 

##What's the problem?

**_Suggestions are too broad and inaccurate_**

Computer-generated recommendations attempt to take an objective approach to something that is inherently subjective.

##What's our solution?

**_Community-generated music recommendations_**

Crowdsourced recommendations from people with relevant music knowledge will produce the most accurate suggestions.

##Design Approach
Landing:
![Landing Page Picture](https://i.imgur.com/CuLTVlJ.jpg)
Our original design was for our landing page was to have one search bar centered in the middle of the page. Any user will be able search songs, however if a user would like to create a playlist, upvote a song, or make a recommendation, they would have to log in.

Main Page:

Once logged in, users will be able to see their playlist (which is imported from their SoundCloud account). Once they click on a recommended song, another path will show up with the top recommendations for that song that they click. If they  choose to upvote or post a song, they can do so in the main view/window.
